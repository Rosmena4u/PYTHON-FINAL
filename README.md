#### បញ្ជី - BANHJI Description
Banhji is a Python-based management tool built to move retail tracking away from messy  paper logs and manual spreadsheets. The system uses Object-Oriented Programming and JSON to automate stock updates and calculate exact profit margins instantly after every sale. By generating structured daily and monthly reports, it eliminates human error and gives small business owners a clear, real-time look at their inventory and financial performance.

### Creating an Admin Account

Before logging in, you need to create an admin account manually.

**Step 1 — Generate Password Hash**

Create a Python file (e.g. `create_hash.py`) and add:

```python
import hashlib
password = "yourpassword"  # Put your password here
hashed = hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()
print(hashed)
```

Run the file and you will see a hash output in the terminal. For example:

```
9e3669d19b675bd57058fd4664205d2a
```

> **Copy this hash — you will need it in the next step.**

---

**Step 2 — Create Admin File**

Create a file called `admin1.txt` inside the `data/` folder and write:

```
admin1,9e3669d19b675bd57058fd4664205d2a
```

---

**Step 3 — Login**

- Login using your username and your **real password** (not the hash)
- If you enter the wrong password 3 times, the system will lock for 5 seconds

---

### Important Notes

- Each admin has their own personal inventory and sales files
- Your password is stored as a hash and is never saved in plain text
- Stock is automatically reduced when a sale is made
- If you forget your password, generate a new hash and update your `.txt` file

    
#### Features
Secure Admin Login: Supports multiple users with MD5 password hashing and account lock after 3 failed attempts.
  1. Inventory Management (CRUD): Add, view, update, and delete products and variants (color, size, etc.), with low stock alerts.
  2. Sales Processing: Automatically generates receipts, updates stock, and calculates total and profit.
  3. Business Dashboard: Displays sales data using ASCII charts, including weekly revenue, peak sales days, and monthly growth.
  4. Data Persistence: Saves all data automatically using:.json for inventory and.txt for sales history

- File handling: Learned how to use os to build file paths and create files automatically
- Module connection: Learned to connect multiple modules so they share the same data
- Data Visualization: Developed custom ASCII and Unicode bar charts to create real-time trend visualizations without external libraries.
- Time-Series Logic: Learned how to apply the datetime library to convert raw data into weekly and monthly calculations for comparative business analysis.
- Data Persistence with JSON: Learned to use JSON for structured data storage, ensuring inventory and sales records are saved and retrieved correctly.
